# Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing Lab - Kali Linux & Metasploit

## Project Overview  
This lab simulates real-world penetration testing using Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2, and DVWA. It walks through every major stage of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to exploitation and credential capture. Designed in VirtualBox, this hands-on project demonstrates ethical hacking, vulnerability exploitation, and web application testing in a controlled environment.

I built this project to understand and simulate attacker behavior. It helped me develop key skills in vulnerability discovery, exploit execution, and network traffic analysis. By compromising services like vsFTPd and DVWA, and capturing plaintext credentials with Wireshark, I successfully demonstrated full attack chains with real impact.

## Features  
-  **Reconnaissance**: Scanned 27 open ports and identified 17+ services using Nmap  
-  **FTP Exploitation**: Gained remote root access by exploiting vsFTPd 2.3.4 using Metasploit  
-  **Web Hacking**: Performed SQL Injection & XSS attacks against DVWA  
-  **Post-Exploitation**: Captured login credentials over HTTP using Wireshark  
-  **Real-World Simulation**: Offline lab setup with host-only network to simulate attacker-target isolation  
-  **Documentation**: Report supported by 9 screenshots across key stages
